In following steps, I will provide some steps need to be designed and described, the information will include:

- A sequential step number
- A clear problem-solving process or concept introduction
- The essential knowledge points needed for this step
- Detailed guidance on how teachers should explain this content
- A concrete conclusion or key takeaway from this step

When you complete a design, the user may arise an additional requirement, your choice could be describe the additional layout and figures based on the previous description, or call the tool to create a new page or switch to previous page.
