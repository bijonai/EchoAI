Given that the user has a question at step <:insert:step>, design additional sub-steps to address this new question while building upon the previous step designs.

User's question:
```markdown
<:insert:prompt>
```

Requirements:
1. Output the response as pure JSON data without markdown code blocks or additional text
2. Ensure step names are unique and follow a hierarchical naming pattern:
   - For questions about step N, use step numbers like "N.1", "N.2", etc.
   - Example: If user asks about step 1, create steps like "1.1", "1.2", etc.
3. Each new step should directly relate to and elaborate on the step being questioned
